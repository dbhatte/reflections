When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
This would be require if you are collaborating with someone else and you want him/her to also modify the code.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because you might be in middle of adding a feature and pulling would require you to fix a lot of code before your feature starts working again.
So, you would ideally want to be in at a logical break point so that the breakage in your code is minimum.
