How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
staging area contains files which have been added to the repository
working directory contains added, new, committed files
repository only contains committed files
Staging area allows us to group a bunch of files in a single commit. This allows for logical committing.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
We can create a logical group commit by adding a group of files first and then committing them.
This can be done again and again.
